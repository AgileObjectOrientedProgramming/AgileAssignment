Welcome to our repository! 
We will use this repository for our Agile project.

## Usage

In order to log in on the application, you must use the `username: admin` and `password: admin`. Initially, you will be logged in as a `logistics` user. 
By following the instructions of the applciation, you can create a new user(either a `client` or a `logistics` user).

The web server is located in the [WebApp](WebApp/) folder. To run it, you need to have `maven` installed (IDEs like vscode install it automatically).

The unit tests are located [here](WebApp/src/test/java/ForYouShipment).
For running a full test-coverage of the project, open a terminal in the project's folder and use the following command:\
` $ ./mvnw clean jacoco:prepare-agent install jacoco:report`\
This will generate a corevage file, which can be viewed using extensions such as `Coverage Gutters` for vscode.\
More details about the test coverage can be seen [here](https://medium.com/@clarkjasonngo/junit-test-with-maven-in-vscode-7546eabd50f7).
